                Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member
                of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on
                Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until
                the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother
                being eaten by a Titan.This event would lead to Eren's intense
                hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off
                the face of the Earth
              </p>
              <p>
                Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave
                him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all
                costs and retake Wall Maria.He then injected Eren with a Titan
                serum.In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert
                joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren
                ranking 5th best,and they joined the Survey Corps following the
                battle of Trost District.

                After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories,
                Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as
                the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his
                home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives
                across the ocean.Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From
                his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans.After
                eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War
                Hammer Titan as well.

          <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
          <p>
            <i class="icon"
              >Eren starts as a young boy living within the walled city of
              Shiganshina, a world surrounded by enormous walls to protect
              humanity from giant humanoid creatures known as Titans. His life
              takes a tragic turn when a colossal Titan breaches the walls,
              leading to the loss of his mother and his determination to seek
              revenge on the Titans.</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="icon"
              >Throughout the series, Eren's character evolves from a vengeful,
              impulsive teenager to a complex leader. He joins the Scout
              Regiment, where he demonstrates exceptional combat skills and a
              relentless pursuit of freedom for humanity. Eren possesses a
              unique ability to transform into a Titan himself, known as the
              Attack Titan..</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="icon"
              >As the series progresses, Eren's motivations become more nuanced.
              His desire for freedom from the Titans expands into a broader
              ambition to free humanity from the oppressive Marleyan rule and
              uncover the mysteries of the world. Eren's character grapples with
              moral dilemmas, and his actions spark a global conflict..</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="icon"
              >Eren's journey is marked by both heroism and controversy. His
              character represents the complexities of human nature, the
              consequences of one's choices, and the pursuit of freedom and
              truth in a harsh world filled with uncertainty..</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="icon"
              >Overall, Eren Yeager's biography is a tale of transformation,
              determination, and the moral gray areas that shape his character
              in the world of "Attack on Titan." It's a story that resonates
              with themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the human spirit.</i
